              "'JULES:– Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?VINCENT What so you want to know?\\nJULES:Well, hash is legal there, right?\\nVINCENT:Yeah, it\\'s legal, but is ain\\'t a hundred percent legal. I mean you can\\'t walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin\\' away. You\\'re only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.\\nJULES:Those are hash bars?\\nVINCENT:Yeah, it breaks down like this: it\\'s legal to buy it, it\\'s legal to own it and, if you\\'re the proprietor of a hash bar, it\\'s legal to sell it. It\\'s legal to carry it, which doesn\\'t really matter \\'cause – get a load of this – if the cops stop you, it\\'s illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don\\'t have.\\nJULES:That did it, man – I\\'m fuckin\\' goin\\', that\\'s all there is to it.\\nVINCENT:You\\'ll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?\\nJULES:What?\\nVINCENT:It\\'s the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they\\'re a little different.\\nJULES:Examples?\\nVINCENT:Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don\\'t mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald\\'s. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?\\nJULES:They don\\'t call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?VINCENT No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn\\'t know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.\\nJULES:What\\'d they call it?\\nVINCENT:Royale with Cheese.\\nJULES:(repeating) Royale with Cheese. What\\'d they call a Big Mac?\\nVINCENT:Big Mac\\'s a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.\\nJULES:Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?\\nVINCENT:I dunno, I didn\\'t go into a Burger King. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?\\nJULES:What?\\nVINCENT:Mayonnaise.\\nJULES:Goddamn!\\nVINCENT:I seen \\'em do it. And I don\\'t mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin\\' drown \\'em in it.\\nJULES:Uuccch! CUT TO: INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking them.\\nJULES:We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.\\nVINCENT:How many up there?JULES Three or four.\\nVINCENT:Counting our guy?\\nJULES:I\\'m not sure.\\nVINCENT:So there could be five guys up there?\\nJULES:It\\'s possible.\\nVINCENT:We should have fuckin\\' shotguns. They CLOSE the trunk. CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building. We TRACK alongside.\\nVINCENT:What\\'s her name?\\nJULES:Mia.\\nVINCENT:How did Marsellus and her meet?\\nJULES:I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress.\\nVINCENT:She ever do anything I woulda saw?\\nJULES:I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.\\nVINCENT:What\\'s a pilot?\\nJULES:Well, you know the shows on TV?\\nVINCENT:I don\\'t watch TV.JULES Yes, but you\\'re aware that there\\'s an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?\\nVINCENT:Yeah.\\nJULES:Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show\\'s called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don\\'t, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. They enter the apartment building. INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait for the elevator.\\nJULES:You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror.\\nVINCENT:Yeah maybe, fat right?\\nJULES:I wouldn\\'t go so far as to call the brother fat. He\\'s got a weight problem. What\\'s the nigger gonna do, he\\'s Samoan.\\nVINCENT:I think I know who you mean, what about him?\\nJULES:Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good. And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace\\'s wife. The elevator arrives, the men step inside. INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING\\nVINCENT:What\\'d he do, fuck her?\\nJULES:No no no no no no no, nothin\\' that bad.VINCENT Well what then?\\nJULES:He gave her a foot massage.\\nVINCENT:A foot massage? Jules nods his head: \"Yes.\"\\nVINCENT:That\\'s all? Jules nods his head: \"Yes.\"\\nVINCENT:What did Marsellus do?\\nJULES:Sent a couple of guys over to his place. They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories. They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses – nigger fell through that. Since then, he\\'s kinda developed a speech impediment. The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.\\nVINCENT:That\\'s a damn shame. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline down the hall.\\nVINCENT:Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned.\\nJULES:Whaddya mean?\\nVINCENT:You don\\'t be givin\\' Marsellus Wallace\\'s new bride a foot massage.\\nJULES:You don\\'t think he overreacted?\\nVINCENT:Antwan probably didn\\'t expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.JULES It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.\\nVINCENT:It\\'s laying hands on Marsellus Wallace\\'s new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin\\' her out – no, but you\\'re in the same fuckin\\' ballpark. Jules stops Vincent.\\nJULES:Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there. Eatin\\' a bitch out, and givin\\' a bitch a foot massage ain\\'t even the same fuckin\\' thing.\\nVINCENT:Not the same thing, the same ballpark.\\nJULES:It ain\\'t no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin\\' his lady\\'s feet, and stickin\\' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain\\'t the same ballpark, ain\\'t the same league, ain\\'t even the same fuckin\\' sport. Foot massages don\\'t mean shit.\\nVINCENT:Have you ever given a foot massage?\\nJULES:Don\\'t be tellin\\' me about foot massages – I\\'m the foot fuckin\\' master.\\nVINCENT:Given a lot of \\'em?\\nJULES:Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I don\\'t tickle or nothin\\'.\\nVINCENT:Have you ever given a guy a foot massage? Jules looks at him a long moment – he\\'s been set up.\\nJULES:Fuck you. He starts walking down the hall.Vincent, smiling, walks a little bit behind.\\nVINCENT:How many?\\nJULES:Fuck you.VINCENT Would you give me a foot massage – I\\'m kinda tired.\\nJULES:Man, you best back off, I\\'m gittin\\' pissed – this is the door. The two men stand in front of the door numbered \"49.\"They whisper.\\nJULES:What time is it?\\nVINCENT:(checking his watch) Seven-twenty-two in the morning.\\nJULES:It ain\\'t quite time, let\\'s hang back. They move a little away from the door, facing each other, still whispering.\\nJULES:Look, just because I wouldn\\'t give no man a foot massage, don\\'t make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass-motherfuckin-house, fuckin\\' up the way the nigger talks. That ain\\'t right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, \\'cause I\\'d kill\\'a motherfucker.\\nVINCENT:I\\'m not sayin\\' he was right, but you\\'re sayin\\' a foot massage don\\'t mean nothing, and I\\'m sayin\\' it does. I\\'ve given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin\\'. We act like they don\\'t, but they do. That\\'s what\\'s so fuckin\\' cool about \\'em. This sensual thing\\'s goin\\' on that nobody\\'s talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin\\'Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin\\' better. That\\'s his fuckin\\' wife, man. He ain\\'t gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.\\nJULES:That\\'s an interesting point, but let\\'s get into character.\\nVINCENT:What\\'s her name again?\\nJULES:Mia. Why you so interested in big man\\'s wife?VINCENT Well, Marsellus is leavin\\' for Florida and when he\\'s gone, he wants me to take care of Mia.\\nJULES:Take care of her? Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.\\nVINCENT:Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don\\'t let her get lonely.\\nJULES:You\\'re gonna be takin\\'MIA Wallace out on a date?\\nVINCENT:It ain\\'t a date. It\\'s like when you and your buddy\\'s wife go to a movie or somethin\\'. It\\'s just... you know... good company. Jules just looks at him.\\nVINCENT:It\\'s not a date. Jules just looks at him. INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out. One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.\\nJULES:Hey kids. The two men stroll inside. The three young caught-off-guard Guys are: MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the scene progresses, back into the corner. ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a \"Flock of Seagulls\" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand. BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut. Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.JULES How you boys doin\\'? No answer.\\nJULES:(to Brett) Am I trippin\\', or did I just ask you a question.\\nJULES:Do you know who we are? Brett shakes his head: \"No.\"\\nJULES:We\\'re associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont\\'ya? No answer.\\nJULES:(to Brett) Now I\\'m gonna take a wild guess here: you\\'re Brett, right?\\nJULES:I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont\\'ya Brett?\\nJULES:Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry \\'bout that. What\\'cha eatin\\'?\\nJULES:Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers?\\nJULES:Big Kahuna Burger. That\\'s that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain\\'t never had one myself, how are they?\\nJULES:Mind if I try one of yours?\\nJULES:Yours is this one, right?\\nJULES:Uuummmm, that\\'s a tasty burger. (to Vincent) Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?\\nVINCENT:No. Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.\\nJULES:You wanna bite, they\\'re real good.\\nVINCENT:I ain\\'t hungry.\\nJULES:Well, if you like hamburgers give \\'em a try sometime. Me, I can\\'t usually eat \\'em \\'cause my girlfriend\\'s a vegetarian. Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger. (to Brett) You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?\\nVINCENT:Royale with Cheese.\\nJULES:Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that?\\nJULES:Check out the big brain on Brett. You\\'a smart motherfucker, that\\'s right. The metric system. (he points to a fast food drink cup) What\\'s in this?\\nJULES:Sprite, good, mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?\\nJULES:Uuuuummmm, hit\\'s the spot! (to Roger) You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what we\\'re here for? Roger nods his head: \"Yes.\"\\nJULES:Then why don\\'t you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid.\\nJULES:– I don\\'t remember askin\\' you a goddamn thing. (to Roger) You were sayin\\'?\\nJULES:We happy? No answer from the transfixed Vincent.\\nJULES:Vincent! Vincent looks up at Jules.\\nJULES:We happy? Closing the case.\\nVINCENT:We\\'re happy.\\nJULES:My name\\'s Pitt, and you ain\\'t talkin\\' your ass outta this shit.\\nJULES:(to Brett) Oh, I\\'m sorry. Did that break your concentration? I didn\\'t mean to do that. Please, continue. I believe you were saying something about \"best intentions.\" Brett can\\'t say a word.JULES Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway. Well, let me retort. Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like? Brett still can\\'t speak. Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in front of an interrogator.\\nJULES:What country you from!\\nJULES:\"What\" ain\\'t no country I know! Do they speak English in \"What?\"\\nJULES:English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-it?\\nJULES:Then you understand what I\\'m sayin\\'?\\nJULES:Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!\\nJULES:Say \"What\" again! C\\'mon, say \"What\" again! I dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say \"What\" one more goddamn time! Brett is regressing on the spot.\\nJULES:Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace looks like!Brett does his best.\\nJULES:– go on!\\nJULES:– does he look like a bitch?!\\nJULES:Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!\\nJULES:Then why did you try to fuck \\'im like a bitch?!\\nJULES:Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck \\'im. You ever read the Bible, Brett?\\nVINCENT:How \\'bout a cup of just plain ol\\' American?\\nVINCENT:At Marsellus\\' request.\\nVINCENT:Not yet. English Dave smiles to himself.\\nVINCENT:What\\'s so funny?\\nVINCENT:Look, I\\'m not a idiot. She\\'s the big man\\'s fuckin\\' wife. I\\'m gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that\\'s all I\\'m gonna do. English Dave puts Vince\\'s coffee in front of him.\\nVINCENT:I ain\\'t your friend, palooka. Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.\\nVINCENT:I think ya heard me just fine, punchy. Butch turns his body to Vincent, when... MARSELLUS (O.S.) Vincent Vega has entered the building, git your ass over here! Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, looking like he\\'s ready to go into the manners-teaching business. BUTCH\\'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure that is Marsellus. Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole\\'s a friend of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now. ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.) Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty. Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays English Dave and walks out of the SHOT. DISSOLVE TO: INT. LANCE\\'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT CLOSEUP – JODY A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in her lips, eyebrows and nose.\\nVINCENT:(interrupting) Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I\\'m curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue? Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.\\nVINCENT:Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.\\nVINCENT:That\\'s a bold statement.\\nVINCENT:Give me three hundred worth of the madman. If it\\'s as good as you say, I\\'ll be back for a thousand.\\nVINCENT:Which one\\'s Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face?\\nVINCENT:You don\\'t mind if I shoot up here?\\nVINCENT:Mucho gracias. Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two continue to talk, Vince shoots up.\\nVINCENT:You know what some fucker did to it the other day?\\nVINCENT:Fuckin\\' keyed it.\\nVINCENT:Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years. It\\'s out five fuckin\\' days – five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it.\\nVINCENT:I just wish I caught \\'em doin\\' it, ya know? Oh man, I\\'d give anything to catch \\'em doin\\' it. It\\'a been worth his doin\\' it, if I coulda just caught \\'em, you know what I mean?\\nVINCENT:Hello? INT. MARCELLUS\\' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT MIA, Marcellus\\' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in the background. Dusty Springfield is singing \"SON OF A PREACHER MAN\". Mia\\'s mouth comes toward a microphone.MIA (into microphone) Vincent. INT. MARCELLUS\\' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT Vincent turns.\\nVINCENT:Hello.\\nVINCENT:(into intercom) Hello. INT. MARCELLUS\\' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT\\nVINCENT:What the fuck is this place?\\nVINCENT:Come on, Mia, let\\'s go get a steak.\\nVINCENT:After you, kitty-cat. INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S – NIGHT Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint English pub. Posters from 50\\'s A.I.P. movies are all over the wall (\"ROCK ALL NIGHT,\" \"HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL,\" \"ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTER,\" and \"MACHINE GUN KELLY\"). The booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars. In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign on the wall states, \"No shoes allowed.\"So wannabe beboppers (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet. The picture windows don\\'t look out the street, but instead, B & W movies of 50\\'s street scenes play behind them. The WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50\\'s icons: MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes. Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red \\'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting a big button on his chest that says:\"Hi I\\'m Buddy, pleasing you please me.\"\\nVINCENT:I\\'ll have the Douglas Sirk steak.\\nVINCENT:Did you just order a five-dollar shake?\\nVINCENT:A shake? Milk and ice cream?\\nVINCENT:It costs five dollars?\\nVINCENT:You don\\'t put bourbon in it or anything?\\nVINCENT:Just checking. Buddy exits. Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a fool.\\nVINCENT:It\\'s like a wax museum with a pulse rate.Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself a smoke. After a second of watching him –\\nVINCENT:Rollin\\' a smoke.\\nVINCENT:It\\'s just tobacco.\\nVINCENT:You can have his one, cowgirl. He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent\\'s hand. He lights it.\\nVINCENT:Think nothing of it. He begins rolling one for himself. As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds. Back to Mia and Vincent.\\nVINCENT:Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.\\nVINCENT:What was it?MIA It was show about a team of female secret agents called \"Fox Force Five.\"\\nVINCENT:What?\\nVINCENT:What was your specialty?\\nVINCENT:Do you remember any of the jokes?\\nVINCENT:Tell me.\\nVINCENT:C\\'mon, don\\'t be that way.MIA No. You won\\'t like it and I\\'ll be embarrassed.\\nVINCENT:You told it in front of fifty million people and you can\\'t tell it to me? I promise I won\\'t laugh.\\nVINCENT:That\\'s not what I meant and you know it.\\nVINCENT:I meant I wouldn\\'t laugh at you.\\nVINCENT:What a gyp. Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake.\\nVINCENT:Can I have a sip of that? I\\'d like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.\\nVINCENT:Yeah, but maybe I do.\\nVINCENT:I don\\'t know if it\\'s worth five dollars, but it\\'s pretty fuckin\\'  good. He slides the shake back. Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.\\nVINCENT:What?\\nVINCENT:I don\\'t know.\\nVINCENT:I don\\'t think we\\'re there yet. But don\\'t feel bad, we just met each other.\\nVINCENT:I\\'ll do that. INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.\\nVINCENT:We\\'re lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn\\'t seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe\\'s section.\\nVINCENT:No there\\'s not. Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.\\nVINCENT:That\\'s Marilyn Monroe... Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –\\nVINCENT:... and that\\'s Mamie Van Doren. I don\\'t see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off.\\nVINCENT:I have moments.\\nVINCENT:Actually, there\\'s something I\\'ve wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn\\'t want to offend you.\\nVINCENT:Only if you promise not to get offended.MIA You can\\'t promise something like that. I have no idea what you\\'re gonna ask. You could ask me what you\\'re gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.\\nVINCENT:Then let\\'s just forget it.\\nVINCENT:Is that a fact? Mia nods her head: \"Yes.\"\\nVINCENT:What do you think about what happened to Antwan?\\nVINCENT:Tony Rocky Horror.\\nVINCENT:That\\'s one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.\\nVINCENT:No it\\'s not, it\\'s just what I heard.\\nVINCENT:They. Mia and Vincent smile.MIA They talk a lot, don\\'t they?\\nVINCENT:They certainly do.\\nVINCENT:No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.\\nVINCENT:No and, that\\'s it.\\nVINCENT:Yeah.\\nVINCENT:At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable.\\nVINCENT:No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn\\'t mean it didn\\'t happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.\\nVINCENT:But did it happen?MIA The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding – then never again. The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you scamps get together, you\\'re worse than a sewing circle. CUT TO:\\nVINCENT:No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.\\nVINCENT:All right, you asked for it. Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.\\nVINCENT:Was than an uncomfortable silence?MIA I don\\'t know what that was. (pause) Music and drinks! Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.\\nVINCENT:I\\'m gonna take a piss.\\nVINCENT:One drink and leave. Don\\'t be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road.LIVING ROOM Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the fat line. CLOSEUP – MIA Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels like it\\'s on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. Then... the rush hits...\\nVINCENT:... It\\'s a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that\\'s very meaningful.\\nVINCENT:So you\\'re gonna go out there, drink your drink, say \"Goodnight, I\\'ve had a very lovely evening,\" go home, and jack off. And that\\'s all you\\'re gonna do. Now that he\\'s given himself a little pep talk, Vincent\\'s ready for whatever\\'s waiting for him on the other side of that door. So he goes through it.\\nVINCENT:Jesus Christ!Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia\\'s fallen body. Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck to check her pulse. She slightly stirs. Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.\\nVINCENT:(sounding weird) Mia! MIA! What the hell happened? But she\\'s unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, but they\\'re not distinctive enough to be called words. Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.\\nVINCENT:(to himself) I\\'ll be a son-of-a-bitch. (to Mia) Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer me honey, what did you take? Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard. Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the rack. He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It\\'s gone. Vincent makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.\\nVINCENT:(yelling toMia) Okay honey, we\\'re getting you on your feet. He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.\\nVINCENT:We\\'re on our feet now, and now we\\'re gonna talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk. We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door. EXT.VINCENT\\'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred. Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, speeds the car into turns and up and over hills. INT.VINCENT\\'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when he glances over at Mia. Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag of water.Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches a number. INT. LANCE\\'S HOUSE – NIGHT At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant drug dealer to a bathrobe creature. He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, \"TAFT, CALIFORNIA\", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand is a bowl of Cap\\'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap\\'n Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in an ashtray. On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three Stooges, and they\\'re getting married. PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS) (on TV) Hold hands, you love birds. The phone RINGS. Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone. It RINGS again. Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up. JODY (O.S.) Lance! The phone\\'s ringing!\\nVINCENT:You still got an adrenalin shot?\\nVINCENT:I need it man, I got a chick she\\'s fuckin\\' ODing on me.\\nVINCENT:No choice.\\nVINCENT:Yeah. She\\'s dyin\\'.\\nVINCENT:Negative.\\nVINCENT:Sorry.\\nVINCENT:Too late, I\\'m already here. At that moment insideLance\\'s house, WE HEARVINCENT\\'s Malibu coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his curtains andYANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH in time to  see Vincent\\'s Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out of SHATTERS from the impact. JODY (O.S.) What the hell was that? Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front lawn. EXT. LANCE\\'S HOUSE – NIGHT Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out.\\nVINCENT:If you\\'re through havin\\' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin\\', get your needle and git it now!\\nVINCENT:This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace\\'s wife. Now if she fuckin\\' croaks on me, I\\'m a grease spot. But before he turns me into a bar soap, I\\'m gonna be forced to tell \\'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn. INT. LANCE\\'S HOUSE – NIGHT WE START in Lance\\'s and Jody\\'s bedroom. Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She\\'s wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on it. We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking through the hall into the living room.\\nVINCENT:She\\'s ODing on us.\\nVINCENT:(to Lance) You two are a match made in heaven.\\nVINCENT:What do you need a medical book for?\\nVINCENT:You\\'ve had that thing for six years and you never used it?\\nVINCENT:I\\'m not fuckin\\' stoppin\\' you.\\nVINCENT:Quit fuckin\\' around man and give her the shot! Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.\\nVINCENT:Does it have to be exact?\\nVINCENT:Well, I don\\'t know exactly where her heart is, I think it\\'s here.Vince points to Mia\\'s right breast.Lance glances over and nods.\\nVINCENT:I need a big fat magic marker, got one?\\nVINCENT:I need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen\\'ll do, but a magic marker would be great.\\nVINCENT:You\\'re gonna give her the shot.\\nVINCENT:I\\'ve never does this before.\\nVINCENT:Okay, what do I do?LANCE Well, you\\'re giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart. But she\\'s got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion. Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like \"The Shape\" killing its victims in \"HALLOWEEN\".\\nVINCENT:I gotta stab her?\\nVINCENT:What happens after that?\\nVINCENT:This ain\\'t a fuckin\\' joke man!\\nVINCENT:Count to three. Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect.\\nVINCENT:What are your thoughts on how to handle this?\\nVINCENT:Well I\\'m of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident. Mia smiles.\\nVINCENT:I seriously doubt that.\\nVINCENT:Let\\'s shake on it. The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake and shake they do.\\nVINCENT:Mum\\'s the word. Mia lets go of Vincent\\'s hand and silently makes the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands. Vincent smiles.\\nVINCENT:If you\\'ll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack. Mia giggles. Vincent turns to leave.\\nVINCENT:Sure, but I think I\\'m still a little too petrified to laugh.MIA Uh-huh. You won\\'t laugh because it\\'s not funny. But if you still wanna hear it, I\\'ll tell it.\\nVINCENT:I can\\'t wait.\\nVINCENT:Mia. How you doin\\'?\\nVINCENT:Why the fuck didn\\'t you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind? Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?JULES (to himself) We should be fuckin\\' dead right now. (pause) Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.\\nVINCENT:.357.\\nJULES:We should be fuckin\\' dead!\\nVINCENT:Yeah, we were lucky. Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.\\nJULES:That shit wasn\\'t luck. That shit was somethin\\' else. Vincent prepares to leave.\\nVINCENT:Yeah, maybe.\\nJULES:That was... divine intervention. You know what divine intervention is?\\nVINCENT:Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.\\nJULES:Yeah, man, that\\'s what is means. That\\'s exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.\\nVINCENT:I think we should be going now.\\nJULES:Don\\'t do that! Don\\'t you fuckin\\' do that! Don\\'t blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin\\' miracle!\\nVINCENT:Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens.\\nJULES:Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn\\'t just happen.\\nVINCENT:Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?JULES We should be fuckin\\' dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin\\' acknowledge it!\\nVINCENT:Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now? EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic. INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and Marvin in the back.\\nVINCENT:... Ever seen that show \"COPS?\"I was watchin\\' it once and this cop was on it who was talkin\\' about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway. He unloads on this guy and he doesn\\'t hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It\\'s a freak, but it happens.\\nJULES:If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin\\' open.\\nVINCENT:What the fuck does that mean?\\nJULES:That\\'s it for me. For here on in, you can consider my ass retired.\\nVINCENT:Jesus Christ!\\nJULES:Don\\'t blaspheme!\\nVINCENT:Goddammit, Jules –\\nJULES:– I said don\\'t do that –\\nVINCENT:– you\\'re fuckin\\' freakin\\' out!\\nJULES:I\\'m tellin\\' Marsellus today I\\'m through.VINCENT While you\\'re at it, be sure to tell \\'im why.\\nJULES:Don\\'t worry, I will.\\nVINCENT:I\\'ll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off.\\nJULES:I don\\'t give a damn if he does. Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his grip.\\nVINCENT:Marvin, what do you make of all this?\\nVINCENT:C\\'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets? Vincent\\'s .45 goes BANG! Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES blood and SHAKES.\\nJULES:What the fuck\\'s happening?\\nVINCENT:I just accidentally shot Marvin in the throat.\\nJULES:Why the fuck did you do that?\\nVINCENT:I didn\\'t mean to do it. I said it was an accident.\\nJULES:I\\'ve seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my time –\\nVINCENT:– chill out, man, it was an accident, okay? You hit a bump or somethin\\' and the gun went off.\\nJULES:The car didn\\'t hit no motherfuckin\\' bump!VINCENT Look! I didn\\'t mean to shoot this son-of- a-bitch, the gun just went off, don\\'t ask me how!\\nJULES:Look at this mess! We\\'re drivin\\' around on a city street in broad daylight –\\nVINCENT:– I know, I know, I wasn\\'t thinkin\\' about the splatter.\\nJULES:Well you better be thinkin\\' about it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road. Cops tend to notice shit like you\\'re driving a car drenched in fuckin\\' blood.\\nVINCENT:Can\\'t we just take it to a friendly place?\\nJULES:This is the Valley,Vincent. Marsellus don\\'t got no friendly places in the Valley.\\nVINCENT:Well, don\\'t look at me, this is your town, Jules. Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.\\nVINCENT:Who ya callin\\'?\\nJULES:A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.\\nVINCENT:Where\\'s Toluca Lake.\\nJULES:On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie\\'s ass ain\\'t home, I don\\'t know what the fuck we\\'re gonna go. I ain\\'t got any other partners in 818. (into phone) Jimmie! How you doin\\' man, it\\'s Jules. (pause) Listen up man, me an\\' my homeboy are in some serious shit. We\\'re in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use your garage for a couple hours.INT. JIMMIE\\'S BATHROOM – DAY Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while Vincent stands behind him.\\nJULES:We gotta be real fuckin\\' delicate with this Jimmie\\'s situation. He\\'s one remark away from kickin\\' our asses out the door.\\nVINCENT:If he kicks us out, whadda we do?\\nJULES:Well, we ain\\'t leavin\\' \\'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie\\'s my friend and you don\\'t bust in your friend\\'s house and start tellin\\' \\'im what\\'s what. Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at the sink.\\nVINCENT:Just tell \\'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.\\nJULES:Put yourself in his position. It\\'s eight o\\'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn\\'t prepared for this shit. Don\\'t forget who\\'s doin\\' who a favor. Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.\\nVINCENT:If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass. When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is stained with red.\\nJULES:What the fuck did you just do to his towel?\\nVINCENT:I was just dryin\\' my hands.\\nJULES:You\\'re supposed to wash \\'em first.\\nVINCENT:You watched me wash \\'em.\\nJULES:I watched you get \\'em wet.VINCENT I washed \\'em. Blood\\'s real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job.\\nJULES:I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn\\'t look like a fuckin\\' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares? But it\\'s shit like this that\\'s gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that... I\\'m tellin\\' you Vincent, you best be cool. \\'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you... Look, I ain\\'t threatenin\\' you, I respect you an\\' all, just don\\'t put me in that position.\\nJULES:Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. He\\'s your friend, you handle him. INT. JIMMIE\\'S KITCHEN – MORNING Three men are standing in Jimmie\\'s kitchen, each with a mug of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.\\nJULES:Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit. Me an\\' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice. You spring this gourmet fuckin\\' shit on us. What flavor is this?\\nJULES:What?\\nJULES:Jimmie –JIMMIE – I\\'m talkin\\'. Now let me ask you a question, Jules. When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front that said, \"Dead nigger storage?\" Jules starts to \"Jimmie\" him –\\nJULES:(playing along) Naw man, I didn\\'t.\\nJULES:Why?\\nJULES:Jimmie –\\nJULES:That\\'s all we want. We don\\'t wanna fuck up your shit,We just need to call our people to bring us in.JIMMIE Then I suggest you get to it. Phone\\'s in my bedroom. INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE\\'S DINING ROOM – MORNING Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.\\nJULES:You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is. If she comes home from a hard day\\'s work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin\\' a bunch of gangsta\\' shit in her kitchen, ain\\'t no tellin\\' what she\\'s apt to do.\\nJULES:I don\\'t wanna hear about no motherfuckin\\' \"ifs.\"What I wanna hear from your ass is: \"you ain\\'t got no problems, Jules. I\\'m on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin\\' directly.\"\\nJULES:You sendin\\' The Wolf?\\nJULES:Shit Negro, that\\'s all you had to say.INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka \"THE WOLF\". We also see The Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.\\nJULES:Aside from how it looks, the car\\'s cool.\\nJULES:Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker\\'s tip-top.\\nVINCENT:(calling after him) A \"please\" would be nice. The Wolf stops and turns around.\\nVINCENT:I said a \"please\" would be nice.The Wolf takes a step toward him.\\nJULES:It ain\\'t that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated.\\nVINCENT:I don\\'t mean any disrespect. I just don\\'t like people barkin\\' orders at me.\\nJULES:I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit!\\nVINCENT:Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he\\'s wrong, he\\'s immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings?\\nJULES:Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass.VINCENT I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I\\'ll take. And you\\'re crossin\\' it. I\\'m a race car and you got me in the red. Redline 7000, that\\'s where you are. Just know, it\\'s fuckin\\' dangerous to be drivin\\' a race car when it\\'s in the red. It could blow.\\nJULES:You\\'re gettin\\' ready to blow? I\\'m a mushroom-cloud-layin\\' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain I\\'m \"SUPERFLY T.N.T,\" I\\'m the \"GUNS OF NAVARONE.\" I\\'m what Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin\\' in the back? You\\'re the motherfucker should be on brain detail. We\\'re tradin\\'. I\\'m washin\\' windows and you\\'re pickin\\' up this nigger\\'s skull. INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript vehicle. The Wolf circles the car examining it. Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job they\\'ve done.\\nVINCENT:All the way?THE WOLF To your bare ass. As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.\\nJULES:This morning air is some chilly shit.\\nVINCENT:Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?\\nVINCENT:What?\\nJULES:Now Jimmie, don\\'t do nothin\\' stupid like puttin\\' that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take away.\\nJULES:Goddamn, that water\\'s fuckin\\' cold!\\nJULES:Ha ha ha. They\\'re your clothes, motherfucker.\\nJULES:Yeah, well, out asses ain\\'t the expert on wearin\\' dorky shit that your is.\\nJULES:Don\\'t do shit unless –\\nJULES:Unless you do it first.\\nVINCENT:I\\'m cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went off, I dunno how.\\nJULES:We cool?\\nVINCENT:Redondo Beach.\\nJULES:Inglewood. Winston grabs Jules\\' wrist and pantomimes like he\\'s in a \"DEAD ZONE\" trance.\\nJULES:Mr. Wolf. He turns around.\\nJULES:I was a pleasure watchin\\' you work. The Wolf smiles.\\nJULES:Wanna share a cab?\\nVINCENT:You know I could go for some breakfast. What to have breakfast with me?\\nJULES:Sure. INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a refill for both men,\\nVINCENT:Thanks a bunch. (to Jules, who\\'s nursing his coffee) Want a sausage?\\nJULES:Naw, I don\\'t eat pork.\\nVINCENT:Are you Jewish?\\nJULES:I ain\\'t Jewish man, I just don\\'t dig on swine.\\nVINCENT:Why not?\\nJULES:They\\'re filthy animals. I don\\'t eat filthy animals.\\nVINCENT:Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good.JULES A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. I\\'ll never know \\'cause even if it did, I wouldn\\'t eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That\\'s a filthy animal. I don\\'t wanna eat nothin\\' that ain\\'t got enough sense to disregard its own feces.\\nVINCENT:How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.\\nJULES:I don\\'t eat dog either.\\nVINCENT:Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?\\nJULES:I wouldn\\'t go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they\\'re definitely dirty. But a dog\\'s got personality. And  personality goes a long way.\\nVINCENT:So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he\\'s cease to be a filthy animal?\\nJULES:We\\'d have to be talkin\\' \\'bout one motherfuckin\\' charmin\\' pig. It\\'d have to be the Cary Grant of pigs. The two men laugh.\\nVINCENT:Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin\\' there all quiet.\\nJULES:I just been sittin\\' here thinkin\\'.\\nVINCENT:(mouthful of food) About what?\\nJULES:The miracle we witnessed.\\nVINCENT:The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.\\nJULES:Do you know that a miracle is?\\nVINCENT:An act of God.JULES What\\'s an act of God?\\nVINCENT:I guess it\\'s when God makes the impossible possible. And I\\'m sorry Jules, but I don\\'t think what happened this morning qualifies.\\nJULES:Don\\'t you see, Vince, that shit don\\'t matter. You\\'re judging this thing the wrong way. It\\'s not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin\\' car keys. You don\\'t judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God\\'s touch, God got involved.\\nVINCENT:But why?\\nJULES:That\\'s what\\'s fuckin\\' wit\\' me! I don\\'t know why. But I can\\'t go back to sleep.\\nVINCENT:So you\\'re serious, you\\'re really gonna quit?\\nJULES:The life, most definitely. Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.\\nVINCENT:So if you\\'re quitting the life, what\\'ll you do?\\nJULES:That\\'s what I\\'ve been sitting here contemplating. First, I\\'m gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I\\'m gonna walk the earth.\\nVINCENT:What do you mean, walk the earth?JULES You know, like Caine in \"KUNG FU.\" Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.\\nVINCENT:How long do you intend to walk the earth?\\nJULES:Until God puts me where he want me to be.\\nVINCENT:What if he never does?\\nJULES:If it takes forever, I\\'ll wait forever.\\nVINCENT:So you decided to be a bum?\\nJULES:I\\'ll just be Jules, Vincent – no more, no less.\\nVINCENT:No Jules, you\\'re gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin\\' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on \\'em. They got a word for \\'em, they\\'re called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that\\'s what you\\'re gonna be – a fuckin\\' bum!\\nJULES:Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ –\\nVINCENT:– what happened was peculiar – no doubt about it – but it wasn\\'t water into wine.\\nJULES:All shapes and sizes, Vince.\\nVINCENT:Stop fuckin\\' talkin\\' like that!\\nJULES:If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin\\' scary questions.\\nVINCENT:I gotta take a shit. To be continued.Vincent exitsfor the restroom. Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.\\nJULES:When he wants it clean.\\nJULES:Funny, I\\'ve been thinkin\\' the same thing.\\nJULES:\\'Fraid I can\\'t do that. Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun right in the middle of Jules\\' face and pulls back the hammer.\\nJULES:Yes, you did. This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but Honey Bunny senses something\\'s wrong.\\nJULES:I don\\'t mean to shatter your ego, but this ain\\'t the first time I\\'ve had gun pointed at me.\\nJULES:You win. Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.\\nJULES:It\\'s all yours, Ringo.\\nJULES:(to Pumpkin) Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!\\nJULES:(softly) Tell her it\\'s gonna be okay.\\nJULES:Promise her.\\nJULES:Tell her to chill.\\nJULES:What\\'s her name?\\nJULES:(to Yolanda) So, we cool Yolanda? We ain\\'t gonna do anything stupid, are we?\\nJULES:Nobody\\'s gonna hurt anybody. We\\'re gonna be like three Fonzies. And what\\' Fonzie like? No answer.JULES C\\'mon Yolanda, what\\'s Fonzie like?\\nJULES:Correct-amundo! And that\\'s what we\\'re gonna be, we\\'re gonna be cool. (to Pumpkin) Now Ringo, I\\'m gonna count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. But when you do it, do it cool. Ready? Pumpkin looks at him.\\nJULES:One... two... three. Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table. Yolanda can\\'t stand it anymore.\\nJULES:Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool. When you yell at me, it makes me nervous. When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that\\'s when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.\\nJULES:That seems to be the situation. Now I don\\'t want that and you don\\'t want that and Ringo here don\\'t want that. So let\\'s see what we can do. (to Ringo) Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin\\' fried chicken. But you  appened to pull this shit while I\\'m in a transitional period. I don\\'t wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. But I\\'m afraid I can\\'t give you the case. It don\\'t belong to me. Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass. VINCENT (O.S.) What the fuck\\'s goin\\' on here? Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at Yolanda.\\nJULES:It\\'s cool, Vincent! It\\'s cool! Don\\'t do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it\\'s cool baby, nothin\\'s changed. We\\'re still just talkin\\'. (to Pumpkin) Tell her we\\'re still cool.\\nVINCENT:(gun raised) What the hell\\'s goin\\' on, Jules?\\nJULES:Nothin\\' I can\\'t handle. I want you to just hang back and don\\'t do shit unless it\\'s absolutely necessary.\\nVINCENT:Check.\\nJULES:Yolanda, how we doin, baby?\\nJULES:Just hang in there, baby, you\\'re doing\\' great,Ringo\\'s proud of you and so am I. It\\'s almost over. (to Pumpkin) Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.\\nJULES:It\\'s the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it. Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there\\'s a wallet with \"Bad Motherfucker\" embroidered on it.\\nJULES:That\\'s my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there?\\nVINCENT:Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I\\'m gonna shoot \\'em on general principle.\\nJULES:You ain\\'t gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I ain\\'t givin\\' it to him. I\\'m buyin\\' somethin\\' for my money. Wanna know what I\\'m buyin\\' Ringo?\\nJULES:Your life. I\\'m givin\\' you that money so I don\\'t hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?\\nJULES:There\\'s a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. \"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother\\'s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\"I been sayin\\' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a cold- blooded thing to say to a motherfucker \\'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin\\' made me think twice. Now I\\'m thinkin\\', it could mean you\\'re the evil man. And I\\'m the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he\\'s the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you\\'re the righteous man and I\\'m the shepherd and it\\'s the world that\\'s evil and selfish. (MORE)JULES (CONT\\'D) I\\'d like that. But that shit ain\\'t the truth. The truth is you\\'re the weak. And I\\'m the tyranny of evil men. But I\\'m tryin\\'. I\\'m tryin\\' real hard to be a shepherd. Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table. Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to Yolanda. She looks back. Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the door. Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a sip of coffee.\\nJULES:(to himself) It\\'s cold. He pushes it aside. Vincent appears next to Jules.\\nVINCENT:I think we oughta leave now.\\nJULES:That\\'s probably a good idea. Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the briefcase. Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes – wearing UC Santa Cruz and \"I\\'m with Stupid\" tee-shirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word.\\n'"

Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\\\\\\\"I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a cold- blooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. (MORE)JULES (CONT'D) I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd. Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.
